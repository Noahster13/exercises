# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.


# Constant for the speed.


# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.



# Print the results for all calculations 

speed = 65
six_distance = speed * 6
ten_distance = speed * 10
fifteen_distance = speed * 15

print(six_distance)
print(ten_distance)
print(fifteen_distance)
